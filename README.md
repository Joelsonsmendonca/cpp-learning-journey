# C++ Learning Journey & High-Performance Studies

Welcome to my C++ learning repository! This is the logbook of my journey to mastering modern C++ and the fundamental concepts of high-performance software engineering.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

My primary ambition is to build a career as a **Game Engine or Graphics Programmer**. This repository serves as the practical foundation for that goal. Every project and exercise here is a deliberate step towards understanding low-level memory management, advanced algorithms, data structures, and the architecture of real-time systems.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

This repository is organized into a single Visual Studio Solution containing multiple projects. Each numbered project corresponds to a specific exercise or concept from my study plan, allowing for isolated and focused development.

## ðŸš€ Key Learning Areas

-   **Modern C++:** Focusing on C++17/20 features, including smart pointers, move semantics, and the Rule of the Five.
-   **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Practical implementations of fundamental structures and solutions to challenges from platforms like LeetCode.
-   **Game Engine Fundamentals:** Building blocks for my personal 2D game engine project.
-   **Professional Tooling:** Consistent use of Git for version control and CMake for cross-platform project building.
